## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

### Day 1-2
On the first day, I created the project and all other relevant documents. On the second day is where I began to setup the files, variables, and HTML skeleton for the page. This consisted of outlining the heirarchy and flow of content with the use of h and p tags, as well as setting up landmark tags for each section of content. Furthermore, by creating reusable scss styles & variables at the start, I will be able to style content throughout the page more efficiently. This is a great starting point that will help me as I work from top to bottom through each section of content. Lastly, all edits and additions are committed to the local repository and then pushed to the remote repository an an update.

### Day 3-5 (Post-Break)
After a holiday break, I returned to the project and quickly ran into a roadblock. My starting point was the top nav and hero section. This included a background with a gradient behind an svg image that acted as an accent with patterns. I was able to succesfully learn how to integrate and utilize the svg image, as well as how to layer it with the background; however, I had trouble perfectly aligning and scaling the image based on the screen size. In the end I was able to reach an implementation that was close but not enitrely ideal for what the project required. Nevertheless, I have learned it is more important to get functional code in place before worrying about fine details. In the future, I would not spend this much time trying to solve such a small aspect and would instead simply move on to the next section.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
